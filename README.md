# K-Means Clustering Implementation

## Overview
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch in Python, including enhancements like K-Means++ initialization, handling empty clusters, and the elbow method for optimal k.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
List the software and libraries required to run your project. Include installation instructions:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn


### Installation
Step-by-step instructions on how to set up your environment and run your code.

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required packages.

### Usage
How to use your implementation. Include code snippets or examples. For example:
```python
from your_kmeans_module import KMeans

# Instantiate and fit the KMeans model
kmeans = KMeans(k=4)
kmeans.fit(X)
